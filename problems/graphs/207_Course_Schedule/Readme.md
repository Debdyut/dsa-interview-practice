# Course Schedule

## 📋 Problem Information
- **Source**: LeetCode
- **URL**: https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Topic**: Graphs
- **Subtopic**: Topological Sort / Cycle Detection
- **Problem ID**: 207

## 🎯 Problem Statement

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are unique.

## 🚀 Approach Overview

### 1. Kahn's Algorithm (BFS / Topological Sort) ⭐ (Optimal)
- **Time**: `O(V + E)`, **Space**: `O(V + E)`
- Uses an in-degree array and a queue to iteratively remove nodes with indegree 0. If all nodes are visited, a valid topological ordering exists (no cycles).

### 2. DFS Cycle Detection (Three-Color Marking)
- **Time**: `O(V + E)`, **Space**: `O(V + E)`
- Maintains node states (`0` = unvisited, `1` = visiting/in current path, `2` = visited/fully processed). If a node in state `1` is encountered during DFS, a cycle exists.

### 3. DFS with Two Boolean Arrays (`visited` and `inPath`)
- **Time**: `O(V + E)`, **Space**: `O(V + E)`
- Uses `visited` array to track globally processed nodes and `inPath` array to track nodes in the current DFS recursion stack.

### 4. Adjacency Matrix + Kahn's Algorithm (For Dense Graphs)
- **Time**: `O(V^2)`, **Space**: `O(V^2)`
- Represents the graph using a 2D matrix instead of an adjacency list. Useful when `E` is close to `V^2` or `V` is small.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- The problem is fundamentally about detecting a cycle in a directed graph.
- If a cycle exists, it is impossible to complete all courses because of circular dependencies.
- Kahn's algorithm is often preferred in interviews because it is iterative and easily adaptable to returning the actual course ordering (LeetCode 210).
- **Tags**: Graph, Topological Sort, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Cycle Detection
